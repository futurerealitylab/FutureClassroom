/*
   This demo shows the beginnings of a procedural texture feature.

   For now the texture is implemented in js/render/core/renderer.js
   (search for 'uProcedure' in that source file). Eventually
   you will be able to specify the procedural texture right here.

   I am giving this to you in its current unfinished state so
   that you can start to play with procedural textures without
   having to wait for the final version.
